# Color
### The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
* rgb values
 **Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255.**
* hex codes
 **Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.**
* color names
   **Colors are represented by
predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.**
### background-color
### When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
### opacity, rgba
### HSL Colors:
* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.
### hsl, hsla
 **CSS3 allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.**
