# How computer work!?? 
The most basic way of thinking of a computer is as an Input/Output machine.
That’s a pretty basic idea: computers take information from external sources (keyboard, mouse, sensors or the internet), store it, process it, and return the result (Output) of that process.
By the way, if you think about it, the moment computers are connected through the internet there’s an ever  ending  loop  of inputs and outputs as the output of a computer  becomes the input of another.

Binary data is a type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system. Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones.
A logic circuit is a circuit that executes a processing or controlling function in a computer.  This circuit implements logical operations on information to process it.
Logic circuits utilize two values for a given physical quantity to denote the Boolean values true and false or 1 and 0 respectively.  Logic circuits have inputs, as well as having outputs which can be dependent on the inputs.  In logic circuit diagrams, connection from one circuit’s output to another circuit’s input is displayed as an arrowhead at the input e
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) This part of the reading will examine the CPU, Buses, Controllers, and Main Memory. Other sections will examine input devices, output devices, and secondary memory.
The central processing unit comes in action when the input has been recorded through input unit. The central processing unit is responsible for actual processing of inputs to generate the output. The central processing unit (CPU) is considered as the brain of the computer. It is also called as Microprocessor
Software is a general term used to describe a collection of computer programs, procedures, and documentation that perform some task on a computer  system.
Hardware is best described as a device, such as a hard drive, that is physically connected to the computer or something that can be physically touched.
