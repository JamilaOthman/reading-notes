# JavaScript & jQuery
* You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be . The result will be a Boolean : true or false .
* Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false .
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator .
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
* Loops check a condition.  If it returns true, a code block will run. 
 * Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition return false.
